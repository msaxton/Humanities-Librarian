## Presentation Prompt:
This position supports research- and curriculum-aligned services to the community of
scholars, instructors, and students engaged in research and teaching in a number of
academic departments, including Classics, Philosophy, and Religious Studies, and the
programs in Early Cultures, Judaic Studies, and Medieval Studies. This position is part
of the liaison librarian team. In our collaborative work environment, librarians use a
service-oriented framework for collection building, instruction, and research support.

Please describe how you will engage with and address the curricular needs of students
and faculty in these disciplinary areas. Please include how your approach advances
racial justice, diversity, and inclusion and creates a sense of belonging in the Library.


## Relationship building is the alpha and omega of librarianship

### Outreach opportunities
* Participate in departmental colloquia
* Participate in reading and discussion groups

### Curriculum mapping as relationship building

#### Understand departmental goals
Skills emphasized in **Religious Studies**: “These skills include: close analysis of texts, images, artifacts, artistic works, and other social data; synthesis of research through written and verbal expression; interpretation of the past and contemporary social issues and communities.“

#### Identify targeted opportunities to make connections with students
**Philosophy** PhD: 3rd year students begin their year with a significant literature review

#### Discover unique characteristics of a program's curriculum
**Judaic Studies** may select any 1000 level course as a capstone course


## Collection development is a community endeavor

A library collection is one of the most important assets a university possesses.

### Characteristics of an ideal library collection
1. A carefully curated library collection should support the curricular needs of the institution.
2. A carefully curated library collection should provide for the interests of the researcher.
3. Researchers should not only see themselves represented in the collection, but they should also be able to find diverse perspectives.

### How to carefully curate a library collection
1. Balance the historic strengths of a library with emerging research materials.
2. Collaborate with the community on collection development projects
3. Optimize collections funds for well-rounded collections.


## Library Instruction is most effective when it is collaborative
The most effective library instruction occurs when it is scaffold and tailored to an assignment.

### Developing course related library instruction
1. Consult with faculty before the semester in assignment design
2. Identify stages of the assignment when students may may need the most support and target those areas for library instruction
3.Begin with desired outcome for each library session and from there develop the materials and activities which will accomplish that goal (Backward Design)
4. When possible, design learning activities that appeal to multiple learning types (Universal Design for Learning)
5.Give students an opportunity to practice what they have learned and a forum for further questions (Assessment)

## [Research Support]

### Consultations
1. Every consultation begins with me asking what they would like to get out of our time together
2. Every consult ends with me asking if they have what they need for the next stage of their research. I also invite them to meet again if that would be useful for them.
3. During a consult my standard practice is to model how I would approach their research need

Sometimes consults aren’t (only) about the research need.
