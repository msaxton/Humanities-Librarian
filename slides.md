## Presentation Prompt:
Please share your perspective on the evolving state of arts & humanities librarianship and explain how this will inform your approach to engaging with Boston University's academic mission in the role of Head Librarian for Arts & Humanities at BU.


## The Arts and Humanities

### The Humanities at BU
Humanities disciplines and methods focus on human experiences through primarily critical, interpretive, or speculative lenses, as distinguished from the empirical and quantitative approaches of the natural and social sciences. [(Source)](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/humanities/)

### The Arts (as I understand them)
The Arts are expressions of human experience whether they be visual, auditory, or written.

### The Humanities (as I understand them)
The humanities are an opportunity to engage in the expressed experience of “the other” in ways that allow us to think creatively and critically about our own experiences.

### The Humanities in Crisis
There is a whole genre of "humanities in crisis" essays, articles, and books. The villain in these accounts is nearly always "Neoliberalism." (And rightly so.)

### A limerick about Neoliberalism by ChatGPT 4.0 mini
Neoliberalism’s the trend,  
Where free markets rule, no amend.  
With privatized care,  
And wealth in the air,  
It’s profit, not people, they tend!

### Addressing the crisis
"The task is to show the distinctive contribution that the humanities can make to all fields of knowledge by keeping alive values that are irreducible to both instrumentality and profitability." (Butler, 2022)

### Addressing the crisis
"The public humanities stand the best chance of accomplishing this task since it not only shows what the humanities have to offer the public sphere, but how various publics are framing what the humanities do within the university." (Butler, 2022)

### Addressing the crisis
"…Boston University is committed to generating new knowledge to benefit society." [source](https://www.bu.edu/about/mission-statement/)
