## The Arts and Humanities

### The Humanities at BU
Humanities disciplines and methods focus on human experiences through primarily critical, interpretive, or speculative lenses, as distinguished from the empirical and quantitative approaches of the natural and social sciences.

### The Arts (as I understand them)
The Arts are expressions of human experience whether that be visual, auditory, or written.

### The Humanities (as I understand them)
The humanities are an opportunity to engage in the expressed experience of “the other” in ways that allow us to think creatively and critically about our own experiences.

### The Humanities in Crisis
There is a whole genre of "humanities in crisis" essays, articles, and books. The villain in these accounts is nearly always "Neoliberalism." (And rightly so.)

### A limerick about Neoliberalism by ChatGPT 4o mini
Neoliberalism’s the trend,  
Where free markets rule, no amend.  
With privatized care,  
And wealth in the air,  
It’s profit, not people, they tend!

### Addressing the crisis
