Historiography explores the variety of approaches, methods, and interpretations employed by historians on a particular topic.


### How do I prepare to write a historiography?

#### Step one: Choose a topic
A good topic is narrow enough that you are not overwhelmed with sources, but broad enough that you are able to find multiple scholarly perspectives. You can narrow or expand your topic based on the work you do in the “preliminary research” phase.

#### Step two: Preliminary research
In the preliminary research phase, you will use reference sources like encyclopedias and handbooks to gather background information on your topic. You can also use published bibliographies.

Examples:
* CREDO Reference
* Oxford Research Encyclopedias
* Oxford Bibliographies

#### Step three: Gather sources
* Begin with a **keyword** search in JumboSearch. Use important terms from your topic and your preliminary research.
* Once you have a few good results, make note of the **subject terms** that have been assigned to them, this will allow you to find closely related sources.

* In addition to JumboSearch, use other library databases
    * America: History & Life
    * JSTOR
    * Academic Search Premier

* Newspapers can also be a good source for this assignment.

#### Step four: Analyze your sources

##### Some general questions to ask:
* When has this topic appeared in history?
* How has it had different meanings at different times?
* Is it important to any events that changed its history?
* Are there major events that altered historical interpretations?

##### Read strategically
* Examine the title, subtitle, table of contents, and index.
* Read the introduction and conclusion first.
* Find 2-3 book reviews to help guide your reading.

##### Take smart notes
* Focus on information relevant to your topic.
* Emphasize ideas over quotations.
* Take notes in complete sentences as much as possible.
